"""
The problem with Quicksort is that its worst-case behavior can occur if the list is sorted
(or almost sorted).Test all 3 algorithms (Heap, Merge, Quick) when sorting already sorted
arrays. How large an array can you do before Quicksort completely bombs?

The bookâ€™s solution is to randomly select the pivot in the partitioning step.
(See Section 7.3).  Implement that change to the algorithm and run experiments
(with accompanying graphs) to show that it actually works.
