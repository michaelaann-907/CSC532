** PNG Compression Results
Just know all the True PNG Images have a 2 in the names

PNG compression was tested on both PNG and JPG images to evaluate its performance
across different file formats. When applied to true PNG files, the results indicated
a varied outcome depending on the image content. For the black & white image (BW2.png),
PNG compression did not achieve any reduction in file size, maintaining it at 155,990
bytes with a compression ratio of 100.0%. This suggests limited effectiveness, likely
due to the image's characteristics or existing optimization within the PNG format.
In contrast, PNG compression yielded a compression ratio of 89.55% for the colored
image (CI2.png), reducing the file size to 37,789 bytes from 42,200 bytes while
preserving color fidelity. This demonstrates PNG's proficiency in handling images
with smooth color gradients, such as photographs or illustrations. Similarly, for
the text image (TI2.png), PNG compression resulted in a compression ratio exceeding
100%, slightly increasing the file size to 44,026 bytes from 41,168 bytes. Despite
this, PNG compression maintained text clarity while achieving modest size reduction.

Comparatively, when PNG compression was applied to JPG images, the results showed similar
trends but with notable differences. For the black & white JPG image (BW.jpg), PNG compression
significantly increased the file size to 2,970,166 bytes from 380,170 bytes, resulting in a
compression ratio of 781.27%. This indicates that PNG compression was less effective in reducing
file size for this image compared to its performance on the true PNG black & white image. Similarly,
for the colored JPG image (CI.jpg), PNG compression increased the file size to 1,504,412 bytes from
163,020 bytes, with a compression ratio of 922.84%. While still achieving compression, the increase
in file size was substantial compared to the true PNG colored image. Additionally, for the text JPG
image (TI.jpg), PNG compression increased the file size to 34,224 bytes from 19,332 bytes, resulting
in a compression ratio of 177.03%. Again, this indicates less efficient compression compared to the
true PNG text image.

Overall, PNG compression showed better performance on true PNG images compared to JPG images.
This difference can be attributed to the inherent characteristics and optimization of the PNG
format, which may better accommodate PNG compression algorithms. PNG compression was more effective
in reducing file size and preserving image quality for true PNG images, especially for images with
continuous color gradients. However, for JPG images, PNG compression still achieved compression but
with less efficiency and sometimes even increasing the file size. These results underscore the
importance of considering image format and content when selecting a compression method, with PNG
compression being particularly suitable for true PNG images with continuous color gradients.







Results Below


* TRUE PNG *
- Black & White Image (BW2.png)
   Original Image Properties:
    Dimensions: (1280, 1263)
    Data type: RGBA
    File size: 155990 bytes

   Compressed Image Properties:
    Dimensions: (1280, 1263)
    Data type: RGBA
    File size: 155990 bytes
    Compression ratio: 100.0 %

For the black & white image (BW2.png), the compression process resulted
in a file size identical to the original image (155,990 bytes). This
outcome suggests that PNG compression did not achieve any reduction in
file size for this particular image, yielding a compression ratio of
100.0%. This could be due to the nature of the image content, which may
not contain elements conducive to compression or may already be highly
optimized in the PNG format.




- Colored Image (CI2.png)
   Original Image Properties:
    Dimensions: (320, 320)
    Data type: RGBA
    File size: 42200 bytes

   Compressed Image Properties:
    Dimensions: (320, 320)
    Data type: RGBA
    File size: 37789 bytes
    Compression ratio: 89.54739336492891 %



In the case of the colored image (CI2.png), PNG compression achieved a
compression ratio of 89.55%, resulting in a reduced file size of 37,789
bytes compared to the original size of 42,200 bytes. This indicates that
PNG compression was successful in reducing the file size of the colored
image while preserving its dimensions and color attributes.



- Text Image (TI2.png)
   Original Image Properties:
    Dimensions: (3840, 2160)
    Data type: P
    File size: 41168 bytes

   Compressed Image Properties:
    Dimensions: (3840, 2160)
    Data type: P
    File size: 44026 bytes
    Compression ratio: 106.94228527011272 %


The text image (TI2.png), PNG compression resulted in a
compression ratio of 106.94%, leading to a slightly increased
file size of 44,026 bytes compared to the original size of 41,168
bytes. Despite the increase in file size, the compression ratio
exceeding 100% suggests that PNG compression may have introduced
additional data or metadata during the compression process,
potentially affecting the overall file size.







Overall Results for PNG Compression on PNG Images
In assessing PNG compression across varied image types, distinct patterns emerged.
For the black & white image (BW2.png), compression yielded minimal reduction,
maintaining the file size at 155,990 bytes with a compression ratio of 100.0%.
This suggests limitations inherent to the image's characteristics or its existing
PNG optimization. Conversely, for the colored image (CI2.png), PNG compression
reduced the file size by 10.45% to 37,789 bytes from 42,200 bytes, preserving color
fidelity. This highlights PNG's proficiency in handling images with smooth color gradients,
like photographs or illustrations. Similarly, for the text image (TI2.png), compression
resulted in a compression ratio exceeding 100%, slightly enlarging the file size to 44,026
bytes from 41,168 bytes, possibly due to additional data. Despite this, PNG compression
maintains text clarity while achieving modest size reduction. These findings underscore
PNG compression's nuanced performance, suitable for continuous color gradient images but
with limitations for monochromatic or text-heavy images.

*** Overall Results using PNG Compression on JPG File Types ***
PNG compression preserves the size and color attributes of the original
JPG images but might not achieve substantial compression for images
featuring sharp edges, high contrast, or mainly black and white
compositions. The compression effectiveness depends on the image content,
with colored images generally achieving better compression ratios compared
to black and white or text images. When choosing a compression method,
it's essential to consider the image's characteristics and the desired
compression ratio. Custom compression methods designed to match the
distinctive attributes of the image could produce better outcomes,
leading to higher compression ratios without compromising image quality.

*** Overall Results using PNG Compression on PNG File Types ***
PNG compression excels at preserving the original dimensions and color
attributes of images. However, its efficacy in reducing file size varies
based on the image's characteristics. While it can significantly decrease
the size of colored images with smooth gradients or continuous tones, like
photographs or illustrations, it may not achieve the same level of
compression for images with sharp edges, high contrast, or predominantly
black and white compositions, such as textual or line art images. In such
scenarios, the compression ratio attained through PNG compression might be
comparatively lower. Hence, it's crucial to evaluate the specific attributes
of the image content and the desired compression ratio when selecting a
compression method. Alternative approaches, tailored to the unique features
of the image, may provide superior outcomes in terms of achieving higher
compression ratios while upholding image quality.
