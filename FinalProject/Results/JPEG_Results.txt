The analysis of JPEG compression effects on various image types, encompassing both
True PNG and JPG formats, provides insights into its efficacy and suitability across
different data compositions.

Beginning with True PNG images, including Black & White, Colored, and Text compositions,
JPEG compression's impact becomes evident. For example, the Black & White PNG image
(BW2.png), initially sized at 1280 by 1263 pixels with a file size of 155990 bytes,
undergoes compression, resulting in a reduced size of 69955 bytes and achieving a
compression ratio of about 2.23. However, subtle changes in mean pixel values and
standard deviations post-compression suggest slight alterations in visual fidelity.
Similarly, the Colored PNG image (CI2.png), initially sized at 42200 bytes, experiences
significant reduction to 9112 bytes, indicating effective compression with a ratio of
approximately 4.63. Notably, while this reduction is accompanied by minor fluctuations
in pixel values and standard deviations, it still maintains acceptable image quality.
Conversely, the Text PNG image (TI2.png), initially sized at 41168 bytes, shows less
favorable results post-compression, with an increased file size (233805 bytes) and
notable changes in pixel values and standard deviations, indicating JPEG compression
may not be ideal for text-heavy images.

Transitioning to JPG images, higher compression ratios compared to True PNG images are observed
across all categories â€“ Black & White (BW.jpg), Colored (CI.jpg), and Text (TI.jpg). This suggests
JPEG compression is more effective with JPG images. However, its efficacy remains dependent on factors
such as image content and intended use.

In summary, JPEG compression appears to work better with JPG images, offering higher compression ratios
and generally satisfactory preservation of visual quality. Nonetheless, its effectiveness across True
PNG images varies, with colored images showing more favorable compression outcomes compared to text-heavy
ones. Hence, when choosing between PNG and JPG image types, considerations such as image content, desired
file size, and acceptable loss of quality should be carefully evaluated to determine the most suitable
compression approach.
