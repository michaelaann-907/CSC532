** Wavelet Compression Results

Overall results

In comparing the results of wavelet compression between PNG and JPG files,
distinct differences emerge in terms of compression efficacy and impact on
image characteristics.

For the black & white images, both PNG (BW2.png) and JPG (BW.jpg)
files underwent wavelet compression. In the case of the PNG image,
the compression ratio was exceptionally high at 8297.56, but this resulted
in a significant increase in file size to 12,943,360 bytes. Additionally,
the mean pixel value and standard deviation were reduced to 0.0, indicating
loss of detail and variance. Conversely, for the JPG image, while the compression
ratio was also notably high at 25602.56, the increase in file size was even
more drastic, reaching 97,333,248 bytes. Similar to the PNG image, the mean
pixel value and standard deviation were altered, suggesting loss of detail
and variance. However, the increase in file size for the JPG image was
significantly higher compared to the PNG image, indicating that wavelet
compression was more effective in preserving file size for the PNG black
& white image.

For colored images, both PNG (CI2.png) and JPG (CI.jpg) files were compressed
using wavelet compression. In the case of the PNG image, the compression ratio
was 7764.93, resulting in a file size of 3,276,800 bytes. The addition of an
alpha channel slightly altered the dimensions, but the overall file size increase
was substantial. Similarly, for the JPG image, the compression ratio was 28266.47,
with a file size of 46,080,000 bytes. The increase in file size for the JPG image
was notably higher compared to the PNG image. Both images experienced alterations
in mean pixel value and standard deviation, indicating loss of detail and variance.
However, the wavelet compression was more effective in preserving file size for the
PNG colored image compared to the JPG colored image.

For text images, both PNG (TI2.png) and JPG (TI.jpg) files underwent wavelet
compression. In the case of the PNG image, the compression ratio was exceptionally
high at 161181.50, resulting in a file size of 66,355,200 bytes. The dimensions
decreased substantially, and the mean pixel value and standard deviation were greatly
altered, suggesting loss of detail and variance. Similarly, for the JPG image, the
compression ratio was 23339.54, with a file size of 4,512,000 bytes. While the compression
ratio was lower compared to the PNG image, the increase in file size was significantly less.
Both images experienced alterations in mean pixel value and standard deviation, indicating
loss of detail and variance. However, the wavelet compression was more effective in preserving
file size for the JPG text image compared to the PNG text image.

Overall, wavelet compression demonstrated varying degrees of effectiveness across PNG and JPG
images. While both file formats experienced significant increases in file size and loss of
detail and variance, the impact was more pronounced for certain image types in each format.
Wavelet compression tended to preserve file size more effectively for PNG images compared to
JPG images, especially for black & white and colored images. However, for text images, the
differences in compression efficacy between PNG and JPG formats were less distinct, with both
formats experiencing considerable increases in file size and loss of detail and variance.
Therefore, the choice between PNG and JPG for wavelet compression should consider the specific
characteristics of the image and the desired balance between compression ratio and preservation
of detail.

In the case of the colored image (CI2.png), the original image had dimensions
of 320x320 pixels with three color channels and a file size of 42,200 bytes.
After wavelet compression, the dimensions remained the same, but an alpha
channel was added, resulting in dimensions of 320x320x4 pixels. The file size
increased significantly to 3,276,800 bytes, with a compression ratio of 7764.93.

- Overall result for Wavelet compression on True PNG Images
Overall, wavelet compression achieved high compression ratios for all images
but at the cost of significant increases in file size and loss of detail and
variance. While it effectively reduced data redundancy, especially in the case
of the text image, it may not be suitable for images where preserving fine
details and color accuracy is crucial. Additionally, the substantial increase
in file size could limit the practical applicability of wavelet compression in
scenarios where storage or bandwidth constraints are a concern.
